# FreshFusion

### Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Fruit Quality Investigation System

**Computer Vision · ESP32 · Multi-View Analysis · Sensor Fusion · Evidence Critic · Local AI**

<br>

> **Decision first. Evidence behind it.**

FreshFusion combines smartphone vision, environmental sensing, relative gas-response analysis, multi-view inspection and evidence validation to produce explainable fruit-quality assessments.

</div>

## About FreshFusion

FreshFusion is an experimental fruit-quality investigation platform built to move beyond traditional single-image freshness prediction.

Instead of asking only:

> **“What does the AI predict?”**

FreshFusion asks:

> **“What evidence supports this assessment, what evidence is missing, and should the result be trusted yet?”**

The platform combines visual evidence from a smartphone camera with physical sensor readings from an ESP32-based chamber.

The final assessment is produced through deterministic logic, while a local Gemma model is used to explain the evidence and result in human-readable language.

# System Architecture

FreshFusion separates evidence collection, analysis, validation, decision-making and explanation.

# Inspection Workflow

FreshFusion uses **one smartphone camera**.

Three physical cameras are not required.

A single frame can provide an initial fruit identity, while additional viewpoints improve surface coverage and verification.

```text
Start Inspection
      ↓
Place Fruit
      ↓
Initial Fruit Identity
      ↓
Confirm Identity if Required
      ↓
Capture Front View
      ↓
Capture Left View
      ↓
Capture Right View
      ↓
Collect ESP32 Evidence
      ↓
Validate Evidence
      ↓
Provisional / Final Assessment
      ↓
Explain Result
      ↓
Human Verification
```

---

# Supported Fruits

Current inspection workflow supports:

**Apple · Banana · Tomato**

Fruit identity can initially be suggested automatically.

Because individual camera frames can occasionally be noisy, FreshFusion also supports operator confirmation.

```text
Camera Prediction
       ↓
Apple / Banana / Tomato
       ↓
Operator Confirmation
       ↓
Stable Inspection Identity
```

This prevents one incorrect camera frame from changing the complete inspection context.

---

# Computer Vision

FreshFusion uses OpenCV-based visual analysis to extract multiple forms of evidence from each captured frame.

Current visual evidence includes:

- Fruit presence
- Fruit identity
- Surface colour distribution
- Brown-region estimation
- Dark-region estimation
- Visible surface damage
- Texture characteristics
- Roughness
- Edge density
- Healthy-surface estimation
- Image-quality checks

FreshFusion can also generate visual evidence artifacts such as:

```text
Original Frame
Defect Overlay
Fruit Mask
Texture Map
Edge Map
```

---

# Multi-View Inspection

FreshFusion does not rely on a single image for the complete assessment.

The same smartphone camera can be moved around the fruit to capture multiple perspectives.

```text
Front
  ↓
Left
  ↓
Right
```

Multiple viewpoints improve:

- Surface coverage
- Damage visibility
- Detection of hidden regions
- Confidence
- Resistance to single-angle errors
- Physical-fruit verification

Multi-view validation is probabilistic and is not presented as true depth sensing.

# Hardware

Current prototype hardware:

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ESP32 | Sensor controller and Wi-Fi communication |
| DHT11 | Temperature and relative humidity |
| MQ135 | Raw / relative chamber gas response |
| Smartphone | RGB camera and multi-view image capture |
| Laptop | Backend, computer vision and dashboard |

Hardware flow:

```

# MQ135 Baseline Analysis

FreshFusion does **not** interpret the MQ135 raw ADC value as exact ethylene concentration.

The current prototype uses the sensor as **relative gas evidence**.

Before inspecting a fruit, the chamber can be measured while empty.

```text
Empty Chamber
      ↓
Baseline Reading 1
      ↓
Baseline Reading 2
      ↓
Baseline Reading 3
      ↓
Baseline Mean
      ↓
Insert Fruit
      ↓
Current MQ135 Reading
      ↓
Relative Gas Delta
```

Example:

```text
Empty Chamber Baseline : 1650 ADC
Fruit Reading          : 1872 ADC
Relative Gas Delta     : +222 ADC
```

This approach compares the fruit against the same physical chamber instead of assuming that one universal MQ135 value represents freshness.

---

# Evidence Validation

FreshFusion checks whether evidence is usable before trusting it.

Visual checks can include:

```text
Fruit Presence
Image Sharpness
Lighting
Object Centering
View Diversity
Multiple Fruit-Like Regions
Screen / Photo Suspicion
```

Sensor evidence can include:

```text
ESP32 Availability
Reading Freshness
MQ135 Baseline
Baseline Stability
Gas Trend
Sensor Warm-Up
Signal Health
```

When required evidence is missing:

```text
FINAL RESULT = LOCKED
```

FreshFusion asks for more evidence instead of automatically forcing a verdict.

---

# Evidence Critic

The Evidence Critic acts as a trust layer between analysis and decision-making.

Example of consistent evidence:

```text
Vision Evidence      → Degrading surface
Sensor Evidence      → Increasing relative gas response
Multi-View Evidence  → Valid
Image Quality        → Acceptable

Result:
Evidence is sufficiently consistent
```

Example of conflicting evidence:

```text
Vision Evidence      → Fresh-looking surface
Sensor Evidence      → Strong relative change
Image Quality        → Poor
Multi-View Evidence  → Incomplete

Result:
MORE EVIDENCE REQUIRED
```

This behaviour is intentional.

FreshFusion is designed to recognize uncertainty instead of hiding it.

---

# Quality Score

FreshFusion separates:

### Provisional Quality Score

A live estimate produced while evidence is still being collected.

Example:

```text
Provisional Quality Score
62 / 100

Final assessment still locked
```

### Final Assessment

Released only when the required evidence conditions are satisfied.

```text
Provisional Estimate
        ↓
Evidence Validation
        ↓
Final Assessment
```

Current scoring logic is experimental and requires larger real-world validation before being treated as a scientifically calibrated quality scale.

---

# Deterministic Fusion

FreshFusion does not allow an LLM to directly determine freshness.

The core assessment combines available evidence through deterministic application logic.

Current prototype logic can combine:

```text
Vision Evidence
       +
Sensor Evidence
       ↓
Quality Assessment
```

Experimental development weights may be used internally.

They should not be interpreted as scientifically validated constants until sufficient labelled data is collected.

---

# FreshFusion Assistant

FreshFusion includes an inspection-aware assistant.

Unlike a generic chatbot, the assistant receives the current inspection evidence.

It can answer questions such as:

```text
Why is the score low?

Why is the final result locked?

What does this MQ135 reading mean?

Which evidence is missing?

What should I do next?

What changed during this inspection?
```

Example:

```text
Question:
Why is the result still locked?

FreshFusion:
The visual evidence is available, but an empty-chamber MQ135
baseline has not yet been recorded.

The current gas value can be displayed, but a meaningful
baseline-relative comparison cannot yet be calculated.

Recommended action:
Record stable empty-chamber baseline readings and continue
the inspection.
```

---

# Gemma + Ollama

FreshFusion uses a local Gemma model through Ollama for explanation.

```text
Inspection Evidence
        ↓
Deterministic Assessment
        ↓
Gemma / Ollama
        ↓
Human-Readable Explanation
```

Gemma is used for:

- Explanation
- Evidence summarisation
- Operator questions
- Recommended next actions

Gemma does **not** override the deterministic assessment.

If Ollama is unavailable, FreshFusion can fall back to deterministic evidence-based responses.

---

# Human-in-the-Loop

FreshFusion supports human verification because real-world validation requires ground truth.

The operator can review the system assessment and record feedback.

Possible actions include:

```text
Accept
Reject
Add Ground Truth
Override
```

Human verification can later support:

- Dataset development
- Error analysis
- Model improvement
- Validation
- Performance measurement

---

# Database & Evidence History

FreshFusion stores inspection information using SQLAlchemy-based persistence.

Stored data can include:

```text
Fruit Samples
Sensor Readings
Fruit Images
Fusion Results
Inspection Profiles
Human Verification
Investigation Snapshots
Inspection Events
```

# Scientific Guardrails

FreshFusion intentionally avoids claims that the current prototype cannot scientifically support.

The project does **not** claim:

```text
MQ135 raw ADC = exact ethylene ppm
```

It does **not** claim:

```text
Reference similarity = model accuracy
```

It does **not** claim:

```text
Fusion confidence = scientifically validated accuracy
```

It does **not** claim:

```text
RGB images directly reveal internal fruit texture
```

It does **not** claim:

```text
Shelf-life prediction without time-series calibration
```

Instead, FreshFusion separates:

```text
OBSERVATION
     ↓
EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT
     ↓
VALIDATION
     ↓
SCIENTIFIC CLAIM
```

# Current Limitations

FreshFusion is an active experimental system.

Current limitations include:

- Freshness scoring requires larger labelled datasets.
- MQ135 is currently used only for relative gas-response analysis.
- Tomato identity support requires further validation.
- Internal fruit quality is not directly measured.
- Shelf-life prediction is not yet calibrated.
- Physical verification through a monocular camera is probabilistic.
- Current fusion logic requires validation against real-world ground truth.
- Lighting and camera angle can still affect visual analysis.

These limitations are documented deliberately rather than hidden.

---

# What Makes FreshFusion Different?

A typical system:

```text

```

FreshFusion:

```text
Camera + Sensors + Multi-View Evidence
                 ↓
         Independent Analysis
                 ↓
         Evidence Validation

                 ↓
         Human Verification
```

FreshFusion is designed around **evidence**, not just prediction.

---

# Vision

The long-term goal is to move fruit-quality assessment away from:

> **“The AI says this fruit is fresh.”**

toward:

> **“These are the observations, these sensors support the assessment, these are the uncertainties, and this is why the system reached this result.”**
